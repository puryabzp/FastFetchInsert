# Fetch and Insertion using Requests_Futures and Prefect for large data

This Python script demonstrates how to efficiently fetch data from a remote API and insert it into a database using the Requests_Futures library for asynchronous HTTP requests and the Prefect library for workflow orchestration.

## Introduction

### Requests_Futures
[Requests_Futures](https://github.com/ross/requests-futures) is an extension of the popular `requests` library that allows making asynchronous HTTP requests. This can significantly improve the speed of fetching data from multiple endpoints or a single endpoint.

### Prefect
[Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) is an open-source Python workflow management system that enables you to build, schedule, and monitor data workflows. It provides tools for orchestrating complex workflows, error handling, and logging.

In this code, we combine the power of Requests_Futures and Prefect to fetch data asynchronously and insert it into a database efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- The required Python libraries (install them using `pip`):
  - asyncpg
  - prefect
  - requests-futures

## Usage

1. **Configure Database and API**:
   - Update the `conf.json` file with your database and API configuration.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script by running it in the terminal using Python.

   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```
3. **Deploy Your flow on prefect**:
   ```bash
   prefect deployment run 'Fetch And Insert/fetch_and_insert'
   ```
4. **Run prefect server and monitor your flow on prefec UI**:
   ```bash
   prefect server start
   ```

5. **View Logs**:
   - The script will log information to the console. You can configure the log output as needed.

6. **Review Data**:
   - After running the script, the data will be fetched and inserted into the database.

## How It Works

1. The script starts by reading configuration settings from `conf.json`, which contains database and API information.

2. It uses Requests_Futures to make an asynchronous HTTP request to the specified API and fetches data.

3. The fetched data is logged, including the time it took to retrieve the data and the number of records received.

4. The fetched data is then inserted into a database using the asyncpg library. The insertion time and the number of records inserted are logged.

5. The code is organized into Prefect tasks, allowing for easy orchestration and monitoring of the workflow.

6. After running the script, you can review the logs to track the data fetching and insertion process.

## How It Handles Large Data

This code is designed to efficiently handle large datasets, making use of asynchronous operations and batch processing for data fetching and insertion. The key factors that allow this code to handle large data effectively are:

1. **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: The code uses the Requests_Futures library for asynchronous HTTP requests, allowing it to fetch data from multiple sources concurrently. As a result, it can efficiently handle large datasets distributed across different endpoints.

2. **Batch Data Insertion**: When inserting data into the database, the code uses batch insertion techniques. This means that it groups data records and inserts them in bulk, reducing the overhead of individual insert operations and significantly improving efficiency when dealing with large volumes of data.

3. **Log-Based Monitoring**: The script logs various details, including the time taken for data fetching and insertion. This logging provides insight into the performance and progress of the data processing, making it easy to monitor and optimize for large datasets.

### Example

As an example, this code can efficiently handle hundreds of thousands to millions of records from a remote API. The exact performance will depend on various factors such as the API's response time, your network speed, and the database's performance. However, it is well-suited for processing and inserting large data volumes with appropriate hardware and network resources.

In testing, this code has demonstrated the ability to fetch and insert 500,000 records within a matter of minutes, making it a reliable choice for large-scale data operations.

Feel free to adjust the code, database, and API configurations to match your specific needs and data volume.
